# hello-world
I consider myself as a strong-willed and independent person who is not afraid to step away from the pack. 

I love exploring new things and being up-to-date with the latest trends and I believe that is where my love for tech comes from.

I am always looking forward to learn new things, meet new people and challenge myself to grow so that I can be a better person, and most importantly to inspire others.
